# Testing Strategy: Real APIs vs Mocks for E-commerce

## **Problem: Current Test Coverage 3% → Target 80%+**

**Your question: "Why are we using mocks? Will this help website testing?"**

**Answer: You're 100% right to question mocks. For e-commerce, mocks are often counterproductive.**

---

## **🚨 Why Mocks Are Dangerous for E-commerce**

### **1. False Security**
```javascript
// MOCK TEST (passes but system broken)
mockStripe.create.mockResolvedValue({ id: 'cs_fake_123' })
✅ Test passes

// REAL SYSTEM (customers can't pay)
❌ Stripe API changed, payments fail
❌ Lost sales: £500-2000/hour
```

### **2. Integration Failures**
- **Database schema changes** - Mocks don't catch field renames
- **API version updates** - Stripe/Supabase changes break real calls
- **Network timeouts** - Real latency issues missed
- **Calculation errors** - Shipping, VAT, totals wrong in production

### **3. Business Logic Gaps**
```javascript
// Mock shows success
mockCalculateTotal.mockReturnValue(25.99)

// Reality: Customer charged wrong amount
calculateTotal(items) // Returns 259.90 (decimal error)
// Result: Angry customers, refunds, lost trust
```

## **🎯 Testing Approach: 3-Layer Strategy**

### **Layer 1: Real Integration Tests (80%)**
**Purpose:** Prevent lost sales from system failures

```javascript
// Test real Stripe checkout
const session = await stripe.checkout.sessions.create({
  mode: 'payment',
  line_items: realProductData,
  // ... real configuration
})

// Verify real response
expect(session.id).toMatch(/^cs_test_/)
expect(session.url).toContain('checkout.stripe.com')
```

**What this catches:**
- ✅ Stripe API changes
- ✅ Database connection failures
- ✅ Calculation errors
- ✅ Authentication issues
- ✅ Rate limiting problems

### **Layer 2: Business Logic Tests (15%)**
**Purpose:** Validate calculations and rules

```javascript
// Test VAT calculation
const total = calculateOrderTotal({
  subtotal: 25.99,
  shipping: 4.99,
  country: 'GB'
})

expect(total.vat).toBe(6.20)  // 20% VAT
expect(total.total).toBe(37.18)
```

### **Layer 3: Component Tests (5%)**
**Purpose:** UI behavior validation

```javascript
// Test form validation
render(<CheckoutForm />)
fireEvent.submit(form)
expect(screen.getByText('Email required')).toBeVisible()
```

## **📊 Real vs Mock Comparison**

| Aspect | Mocks | Real APIs | Winner |
|--------|-------|-----------|--------|
| **Catch Integration Failures** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | Real APIs |
| **Catch Calculation Errors** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | Real APIs |
| **Catch API Changes** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | Real APIs |
| **Test Speed** | ✅ Fast | ⚠️ Slower | Mocks |
| **Setup Complexity** | ✅ Simple | ⚠️ Complex | Mocks |
| **Prevent Lost Sales** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | **Real APIs** |

**For e-commerce, preventing lost sales outweighs test speed.**

## **🎯 Key Takeaway**

**"Testing with real APIs catches the failures that mocks hide."**

For e-commerce platforms where every failure means lost sales, integration testing with real systems is essential. Mocks have their place for isolated unit tests, but business-critical functionality must be tested end-to-end with actual services.

**Your 3% coverage increases to 80%+ by focusing on:**
1. ✅ Real API integrations (Stripe, Supabase)
2. ✅ Actual business calculations
3. ✅ Live error monitoring
4. ✅ Performance validation

This approach directly prevents the lost sales you mentioned as the #1 priority.
