## 🔧 **IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED**

### 1. Database Schema Updates (Priority 1)
**Add missing columns to existing tables:**

```sql
-- Product variants inventory fields
ALTER TABLE product_variants 
ADD COLUMN low_stock_threshold INTEGER DEFAULT 5,
ADD COLUMN track_inventory BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
ADD COLUMN weight_grams INTEGER DEFAULT 200;

-- Orders enhanced status fields  
ALTER TABLE orders
ADD COLUMN fulfillment_status TEXT DEFAULT 'pending',
ADD COLUMN shipping_method TEXT,
ADD COLUMN tracking_number TEXT;
```

### 2. Create New Tables (Priority 2)
**These tables enhance functionality but aren't critical:**
- `shipping_rates` - Dynamic rate management
- `inventory_movements` - Stock audit trail
- `order_status_history` - Order lifecycle tracking
- `email_notifications` - Email delivery logging

### 3. Email Service Configuration (Priority 3)
**Add environment variables for email notifications:**
```env
# Hostinger SMTP (recommended for custom domain)
HOSTINGER_EMAIL_HOST=mail.militarytees.co.uk
HOSTINGER_EMAIL_USER=orders@militarytees.co.uk
HOSTINGER_EMAIL_PASS=your_email_password
HOSTINGER_EMAIL_PORT=465
HOSTINGER_EMAIL_SECURE=true

# OR Resend (current working setup)
RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key
```
